# Analysis plan

This is a sketch for your *analysis plan*, along with some instructions.

Feel free to edit anything here. You may well want to digitally burn the
instructions here after reading, to make space for your own thoughts.

First, we should say that the term *analysis plan* is a big grand for what we
are asking for here.  We wanted to use this week for:

1. Practice on some Git / Github collaboration *with us and with each other*.
2. Practice on editing [Markdown text](https://www.markdowntutorial.com).
3. Giving you a chance to ask us questions about the project.
4. Making sure you're ready to get going with improving your code to detect
   outliers.
5. Making a sketch of what you want to do over the next week or two for the
   project.

## Github practice, questions

You are going to get this file (`analysis_plan.md`) as a *pull request*
(PR) to your repository.

Your first job is to use this pull request to ask questions of us, your
instructors.

What we propose you do, is use the pull-request (PR) interface to ask for
clarification about the task, or the project.  You can enter comments in the
PR interface, or go the "Files changed" tabs, and click on individual lines to
add comments or questions about specific lines in the file.

Once you are happy you've understood the task, merge this PR.

## On Markdown

The file is in Markdown format.

Markdown is a *markup language*.  A Markdown file is a conventional text file
that you can open in any text editor.  The special aspect of a Markdown file is
the *markup*.   Markup consists of special bits of text that specify
*formatting* of the text.  For example, in order to make a word in **bold**
text, using Markdown markup, you put two asterisks either side of the text you
want to be in bold.  When you want a properly formatted version of your
Markdown file, you convert it to the formatted version, using a *Markdown
renderer*.  A Markdown renderer is some system that can interpret the Markdown
markup and display the text as you intended, with bold text as bold, headings
as headings and so on.

There are very many Markdown renderers, but the Github site is one.   When you
put a `.md` file into your repository, like this one, and then navigate to the
relevant file in the Github web interface, you will see that Github has
*rendered* the Markdown formatting, showing bold as **bold**, headings as
headings, and so on.

Markdown has become the standard way of writing text files with markup, and you
will see it everywhere on systems that programmers use, such as Github, and in
the Jupyter notebook.

Markdown has many dialects, meaning that there is some markup that every
Markdown renderer understands, such as **bold**, and other markup that only
some renderers understand.  The Markdown that every renderer understands is
called [standard Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax). Github
has its own dialect of Markdown, called [Github flavored
Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github).
You can usually stick to the standard stuff, but you may need to consult the
Github documents if you want to do something slightly more fancy, like a table.

## Making sure you're ready

To be ready to get going on your project you need to make sure you have merged these three PRs:

* "add-dvars"
* "Add machinery to install module directory."
* "Fix use of Path in find_outliers script"

Make sure you've done the exercises there.  Run the following checks, from the
homeworks:
